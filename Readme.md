## Introduction

This project introduces a groundbreaking collection of Text-to-Speech models specifically designed for Ugandan languages. These models represent a significant advancement in African language technology, addressing the critical gap in speech synthesis capabilities for Uganda's diverse linguistic landscape.

The Uganda TTS model family consists of fine-tuned versions of the **Orpheus 3B model**, each specialized for different Ugandan languages while maintaining quality speech synthesis capabilities. Each language model supports multiple distinct speaker voices, enabling versatile applications in education, accessibility, content creation, and digital preservation of Ugandan languages.

These models are designed to serve researchers, developers, educators, and content creators who need high-quality speech synthesis in Ugandan languages, contributing to the broader goal of digital language preservation and accessibility in Africa.

## Model Architecture

The Uganda TTS models utilize a sophisticated two-stage architecture:

1. **Audio Token Generation**: The models generate audio tokens based on the SNAC (Structured Neural Audio Codec) framework
2. **Fine-tuned Processing**: These audio tokens are then processed through specialized fine-tuned versions of the Orpheus 3B model, each optimized for specific Ugandan languages

This architecture enables efficient and high-quality speech synthesis while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for various deployment scenarios. More about the Orpheous Models [here](https://canopylabs.ai/releases/orpheus_can_speak_any_language)

## Access & Usage

The models are openly accessible and available for research and development purposes:

**ðŸ”— [HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/uganda-tts-models)**

All models are provided under an open-source license, encouraging collaboration and further development in African language technologies.

## Limitations

While these models represent significant progress in Ugandan language TTS, there are some current limitations:

- **Non-English Language Quality**: The non-English models may occasionally produce lower quality outputs compared to the English model. This is primarily due to the SNAC audio codec not being pre-trained on these languages, which affects the initial audio token generation quality.

- **Speaker Consistency**: Non-English voices may sometimes generate speech that does not perfectly match the specified speaker characteristics due to limited training data for certain voice-language combinations.

- **Language Coverage**: Current models focus on five major Ugandan languages, with plans to expand to additional languages based on data availability and community needs.

**Note**: We are actively working on an improved version that addresses these limitations, including training SNAC on a more diverse set of languages and expanding the training datasets for better speaker fidelity.
